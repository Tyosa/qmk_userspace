# QMK Userspace

This is my personal userspace for QMK. The keyboard I am currently using is a Kyria Rev 3, with a Colemak-DH layout with heavy [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) inspiration. It also makes use of Sunaku's [bilateral combination](https://sunaku.github.io/home-row-mods.html).

The keymap I use is available under [keyboards/splitkb/kyria/keymaps/tyosa](./keyboards/splitkb/kyria/keymaps/tyosa).

# To-Do

- [] Switch KC_GUI key with Win+S on left thumb
- [] Add caps word qmk feature
- [] Add combos on accent keys (éèçàôù) to put them to uppercase -> single tap = lower, double tap = upper
